# Advent of Code 2024 solutions
this is a workspace setup so that i can just plop down a new file for each
new day and test it in the same way, in the same place. the `run.sh` file expects
an argument for the day number. its not robustly handled or anything, lol.

the inputs go into an `inputs` directory, which is `.gitignore`'d for privacy.
the expected file layout and syntax is viewable in `src/main.py`. again, not actually
handled cleanly or anything
